Generate three compelling LinkedIn posts to promote a new YouTube video, based on the provided script. Each post should drive engagement, demonstrate authority, and encourage professional discussion.

# Input
{USER_INPUT}

# Instructions

1. **Script Analysis:**  
   - Identify three core takeaways:
     - *Highlight Moment:* A surprising, impressive, or insightful scene (hook).
     - *Key Message:* The core lesson, value, or outcome for professionals.
     - *Engagement Question:* A prompt or challenge that invites thoughtful comments or sharing of expertise.

2. **Copy Creation:**  
   For **each takeaway**, create:
   - **Short LinkedIn Post:** 100 characters or less. Clear, punchy, professional hook with 2–3 relevant hashtags.
   - **Long LinkedIn Post:** 140–250 characters. Expands on the idea, uses strong verbs, states clear professional benefit, includes a CTA (e.g., “Watch now”, “Share your insights”, “Let’s connect”), and 3–5 researched hashtags.

3. **LinkedIn Best Practices:**
   - Use strong, precise verbs and value-focused statements.
   - Research and include 3–5 professional or industry-relevant hashtags (use LinkedIn trending and niche tags).
   - Hook with a bold statement, surprising result, or big question in the first sentence.
   - Pose questions that spark meaningful professional conversation.
   - End with a call to action: “Watch now”, “Share your thoughts”, “Comment below”, or “Connect to discuss”.
   - Maintain a professional yet approachable tone—avoid slang, but be conversational and authentic.
   - Add line breaks for readability, especially in longer posts.
   - Optional: Tag relevant companies, creators, or thought leaders (if relevant and appropriate).
   - Avoid engagement bait and clickbait; focus on real value and credibility.
